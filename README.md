# Smoke Signal - Fire Emergency Locator

## Project Description
We created an app where users can search the latest data of recent fire incidents in Seattle using the Google Maps API and the Seattle Real Time Fire Data API. 

## Motivation for Development
Our motivation for this project was to create an app for users to quickly and easily identify any incidents nearby in case they need to prepare for evacuation or provide assistance. Additionally to reroute their commute in case the incident leads to traffic congestion.

## User Story

```
AS A user concerned about nearby 911 Fire emergencies
I WANT to know where recent incidents have occurred
SO THAT I can avoid those areas if necessary
```

## Mock Up
